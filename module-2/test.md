4. The `0o` prefix means that the number after it is denoted as:
> octal

5. The `\n` digraph forces the `print()` function to:
> break the output line

6. What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing `3` and `6` respectively?
```python
x = input()
y = int(input())

print(x * y)
```
> `333333`

7. What is the output of the following snippet?
```python
y = 2 + 3 * 5.
print(Y)
```
> the snippet will cause an execution error

10. What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing `11` and `4` respectively?
```python
x = int(input())
y = int(input())

x = x % y
x = x % y
y = y % x

print(y)
```
> `1`

11. The meaning of the **keyword parameter** is determined by:
> the argument's name specified along with its value

12. What is the output of the following snippet?
